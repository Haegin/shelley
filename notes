## Bring your shell to life

### The basics

* Return values ($?)
* Boolean operations

### Useful Programs

* grep (ripgrep)
* less
* tee
* head/tail
* cut
* sort
* uniq
* find
* xargs
* tee
* tr

### Variables & Substitution

* ${}
* $()
* $(())
* ${foo/bar/baz}

### Redirection

* Standard input, output and error
* Pipes
* Redirecting to files
* Process substitution - diff holidays.txt <(sort -M holidays.txt)

### Using Your History

* history
* Ctrl+R
* !!
* !-1
* !$ & !^

#### Adding peas (The history command)
- touch vegetable/legumes/pea
- mkdir $(dirname !$)
- history 5
- !-3

#### Categorising other legumes (Expansion and Replacement)
- mv vegetables/{"broad bean",legumes/}
- ^"broad bean"^peanut
- ls !$

#### Adding more animals (Modifiers)
- touch animal/mammal/bat
- !!:gs/bat/mammoth
- ls !$:h

### ZSH is better

* Globbing with ~
* Safer redirections with >!
* Esc+q
* Better tab completion

### Globbing

* * and **
* ?
* [...] and [^...]

### Aliases

* really easy way to add power to your shell.
* there are some limitations - you can't use variable substitution because it's
  evaluated at the time the alias is created.

### Git

* similar, but automatically prefixed with `git`.

### Functions

* more powerful than aliases as you can use variable substitution.
